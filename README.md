This project creates a web-app feturing a fully functioning calculator.  It is coded in Javascript and structured/styled using HTML/CSS.  The layout of the calculator buttons was created with help from CSS Grid and the Grid Inspector Tool in Firefox.  


This web-app works best in Firefox and Chrome.
